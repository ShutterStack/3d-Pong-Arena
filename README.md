## Deploying to Vercel

This project is ready to be deployed to Vercel. Follow these steps to get your 3D Pong Arena live:

### 1. Push to a Git Repository

Push your project's code to a new repository on a Git provider like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

### 2. Import Project on Vercel

- Go to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
- Click the **"Add New..."** button and select **"Project"**.
- Import the Git repository you just created. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project.

### 3. Configure and Deploy
